## About Market API
Market API almost completely repeats WEB requests. Query parameters match. The only differences are the presence of PUT and DELETE methods (more on that below).
For example, a request to book an account on the WEB looks like this: lolz.guru/market/123/reserve?price=<price>, and an API request looks like this: **api**.lolz.guru/market/123/reserve?price=<price>
